# DATAvengers - Weather Analyzer

This collaborative project is our group's final project for INFO 201 in Spring Quarter. We are creating an interactive explorer for various weather datasets called The Weather Analyzer.

The contributors towards this project call themselves the DATAvengers. The members are:
* Ayah Idris
* April Huang
* Arjun Singh
* Hemil Gajjar

The data sources that guide our focus for this project are:
* Temperature and Precipitation data in Seattle
* Event Data for Seattle
* International Temperature Data
* City-level Humidity and Temperature Data

The questions we aim to answer are:
1. What are some historical year-long weather patterns for Seattle?
2. Can these patterns accurately predict future weather?
3. Using forecast predictions, what is the appropriate gear to wear and what activities are suitable for the Seattle weather?
4. What is the relationship between population size and temperature in Seattle?

*The Weather Analyzer* is hosted at: https://hemilg.shinyapps.io/weather_analyzer/.
